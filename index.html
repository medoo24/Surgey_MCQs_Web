The primary and safest treatment for this condition is free water restriction. Hypertonic saline is reserved for severe, symptomatic cases (e.g., seizures) due to the risk of central pontine myelinolysis."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11001, "q": "A 45-year-old woman with Crohn's disease and a small intestinal fistula develops tetany during the second week of parenteral nutrition.

Magnesium is a crucial cofactor for both parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and its action on target tissues. In patients with significant gastrointestinal losses (like a fistula), magnesium depletion is common and leads to a state of functional hypoparathyroidism."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11003, "q": "A 65 year old man with cancer of the rectum undergoes a difficult abdomino-perineal resection during which he receives three units of packed RBCS. 4 hours post-operatively in the intensive care unit he is bleeding heavily from his perineal wound.

The next step should be:", "o": ["Barium enema.", "Upper gastro-intestinal series.", "Angiography.", "Ultrasonography.", "Colonoscopy."], "correct": 2, "e": "This patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings, in the setting of a low-flow state (cardiogenic shock from MI), is classic for acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Angiography (specifically, CT angiography or conventional angiography) is the gold standard for diagnosing AMI, as it can visualize occlusions or stenoses in the mesenteric vessels."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11006, "q": "A 30-year-old woman in the last trimester of pregnancy suddenly develops massive swelling of the left lower extremity.

A non-invasive test like impedance plethysmography (or more commonly today, duplex ultrasound) should be the first diagnostic step to avoid radiation.

Stored packed RBCs lack platelets and labile clotting factors, specifically Factor V and Factor VIII.

EN helps maintain gut mucosal integrity, prevents bacterial translocation, and stimulates gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which leads to a significant reduction in infectious complications, particularly in critically ill patients."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11011, "q": "Which of the following surgical interventions is least likely to provide acceptable prolongation of life for patients with AIDS?", "o": ["Splenectomy for AIDS-related idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.", "Colonic resection for perforation secondary to cytomegalovirus infection.", "Cholecystectomy for acalculous cholecystitis.", "Tracheostomy for ventilator dependent patients with respiratory failure.", "Gastric resection for a bleeding gastric lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma."], "correct": 3, "e": "In patients with advanced AIDS, respiratory failure often signifies end-stage disease with a very poor prognosis, such as from Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or other overwhelming infections.

The half-life of some factors, like Factor VII, is very short (4-6 hours). To ensure peak factor levels at the time of surgical incision, FFP should be transfused immediately before the operation, making 'on call to surgery' the optimal timing."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11014, "q": "Signs and symptoms of hemolytic transfusion reactions include:", "o": ["Hypothermia.", "Hypertension.", "Polyuria.", "Abnormal bleeding.", "Hypotension at the transfusion site."], "correct": 3, "e": "Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions trigger a massive inflammatory and coagulation cascade.

Which of the following actions is most appropriate?", "o": ["Removing all suture material and packing the wound with moist sterile gauze.", "Prompt re-suturing of the fascia in the operating room.", "Starting intravenous antibiotics.", "Placing an abdominal binder.", "Bed rest."], "correct": 3, "e": "A small, contained fascial dehiscence (<2-3 cm) without evisceration can often be managed conservatively, especially if the patient is stable. An abdominal binder provides support to the abdominal wall, reduces stress on the remaining sutures, and can prevent further separation of the fascial edges while healing occurs."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11016, "q": "Which of the following are the most potent mediators of the inflammatory response?", "o": ["Corticosteroids.", "Heat shock proteins.", "Cytokines.", "Eicosanoids."], "correct": 2, "e": "Cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1), are the principal signaling molecules that orchestrate the entire inflammatory cascade. They are responsible for activating immune cells, inducing fever, and mediating the systemic effects of inflammation and sepsis.

This condition represents a failure of the primary fascial closure and carries a high risk of evisceration. The definitive treatment is an immediate return to the operating room for formal re-suturing of the fascia."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11018, "q": "A patient suspected of having a hemolytic transfusion reaction should be managed with:", "o": ["Removal of non-essential foreign body irritants e.g. Foley catheter.", "Fluid restriction.", "0.1ml HCL infusion.", "Steroids.", "Fluids and Mannitol."], "correct": 4, "e": "Management of a hemolytic transfusion reaction focuses on stopping the transfusion immediately and preserving renal function. The breakdown of red blood cells releases free hemoglobin, which is nephrotoxic. Aggressive intravenous fluid hydration and an osmotic diuretic like mannitol are given to induce a brisk diuresis and flush the hemoglobin from the renal tubules."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11019, "q": "A 23 year old woman undergoes total thyroidectomy for cancer of the thyroid gland.

For symptomatic hypocalcemia, the initial treatment is immediate intravenous calcium gluconate to stabilize the neuromuscular membrane and prevent tetany or laryngospasm.

A key feature is decreased peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3. Despite low T3/T4 levels, TSH release is paradoxically not increased and often remains normal or low, indicating a central suppression of the HPT axis rather than a compensatory response."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11021, "q": "A correct statement regarding 5% dextrose in 0.9% saline is which of the following:", "o": ["It contains the same concentration of sodium ions as plasma.", "It can be given in large quantities without seriously affecting acid-base balance.", "It is iso-osmotic with plasma.", "It has pH of 7.4.", "It may cause a dilutional acidosis."], "correct": 4, "e": "0.9% saline (Normal Saline) contains 154 meq/L of both sodium and chloride. Plasma chloride is only about 103 meq/L.

Despite its acidic pH in the bag, the lactate it contains is metabolized by the liver into bicarbonate, making it an alkalinizing fluid in the body."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11023, "q": "Prophylactic regimens of documented benefit in decreasing the risk of post-operative thrombo-embolism include:", "o": ["Early ambulation.", "Elastic stockings.", "External pneumatic compression devices placed on the upper extremities.", "Leg elevation for 24 h post-operatively.", "Dipyridamole therapy for 48h post-operatively."], "correct": 1, "e": "While both pharmacologic (heparin) and mechanical methods are used for DVT prophylaxis, graduated compression (elastic) stockings are a simple and effective mechanical method. They work by providing a pressure gradient that decreases venous stasis in the lower extremities. Intermittent pneumatic compression is also highly effective."}, {"part": "General Surgical Principles", "file": "General Surgery Review Part One 1.html", "id": 11024, "q": "Signs and symptoms associated with early sepsis include:", "o": ["Increased arterio-venous oxygen difference.", "Respiratory acidosis.", "Decreased cardiac output.", "Hypoglycemia.", "Cutaneous vaso-dilation."], "correct": 4, "e": "Early sepsis, or 'warm shock', is a hyperdynamic state characterized by systemic vasodilation. This leads to warm, flushed skin and a high cardiac output to compensate for the decreased systemic vascular resistance.
